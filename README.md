This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## TwicPics configuration

### Requirement

The only requirement is to have a TwicPics account.
If you don't already have one, you can easily [create your own TwicPics account for free](https://account.twicpics.com/signup).

### Configuring `@twicpics/components`

While waiting for the new version of the components, you must create a component named twicInstall.tsx as in `src/app/twicInstall.tsx`.

This component is then used within `src/app/layout.tsx`

### Using TwicPics

As TwicPics components are `Clients Components`, they must be placed in components decorated by `use client;`.

See [https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials).
